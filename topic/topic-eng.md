**Dilemma:** Personal identity vs. moral responsibility  
**Key Chapter:** *Part 3 – Personal Identity*  
📌 **Core Argument:**  
Parfit challenges the traditional view of **personal identity as continuity of a single self**, arguing that identity is not what matters in survival. He introduces the **"branching selves"** thought experiment, where a person splits into two distinct individuals—raising a dilemma:  
- Should each new individual be held morally responsible for the original person’s past actions?

**Dilemma:** Human rights vs. economic justice  
**Key Chapter:** *Chapter 6 – The Neoliberal Turn*  
📌 **Core Argument:**  
Moyn argues that **modern human rights discourse has prioritized civil and political rights while ignoring economic inequality**. He raises a central dilemma:

# 고전, 일반적 주제

Here are some recommended passages from classic and contemporary academic works that present clear **dilemmas and scholarly disputes**. These excerpts can serve as strong material for summary practice, as they engage with **tensions, paradoxes, and fundamental questions in philosophy, law, and ethics**.

---

### **1️⃣ John Stuart Mill – *On Liberty* (1859)**
**Dilemma:** The conflict between individual liberty and societal authority.  
**Key Passage:**
> “The worth of a state, in the long run, is the worth of the individuals composing it; and a state that dwarfs its men, in order that they may be more docile instruments in its hands even for beneficial purposes, will find that with small men no great thing can really be accomplished.”

💡 **Why?**  
This passage challenges the dilemma of **state power vs. individual freedom**—should a government shape its citizens for stability, or should individuals be free to develop autonomously, even at the cost of social order?

---

### **2️⃣ Karl Marx – *The Communist Manifesto* (1848)**
**Dilemma:** The paradox of capitalism's success and its self-destruction.  
**Key Passage:**
> “The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production… All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify.”

💡 **Why?**  
Marx presents the contradiction that capitalism is both **incredibly productive and inherently self-destructive**—it drives progress but also creates instability, leading to its own downfall.

---

### **3️⃣ John Rawls – *A Theory of Justice* (1971)**
**Dilemma:** Equality vs. fairness in distributive justice.  
**Key Passage:**
> “Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory, however elegant and economical, must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise, laws and institutions no matter how efficient and well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.”

💡 **Why?**  
Rawls confronts the **tension between efficiency and justice**—should societies prioritize maximum economic output, or should they ensure fairness even at the cost of efficiency?

---

### **4️⃣ Judith Jarvis Thomson – *A Defense of Abortion* (1971)**
**Dilemma:** The rights of the mother vs. the fetus.  
**Key Passage:**
> “If you find yourself attached to a famous violinist against your will, and your kidneys are keeping him alive, do you have a moral obligation to stay connected for nine months? Does his right to life outweigh your right to bodily autonomy?”

💡 **Why?**  
This passage presents a famous ethical **thought experiment** that forces us to question how we balance **personal autonomy against the right to life**.

---

### **5️⃣ Thomas Hobbes – *Leviathan* (1651)**
**Dilemma:** The necessity of authoritarian rule vs. the danger of tyranny.  
**Key Passage:**
> “In the nature of man, we find three principal causes of quarrel: first, competition; secondly, diffidence; thirdly, glory. The first maketh men invade for gain; the second, for safety; and the third, for reputation. Hence it comes to pass that where there is no common power, there is no law; where no law, no injustice.”

💡 **Why?**  
Hobbes presents a **fundamental dilemma**: is absolute sovereignty the only way to prevent societal collapse, or does it create a new form of oppression?

---

### **6️⃣ Peter Singer – *Famine, Affluence, and Morality* (1972)**
**Dilemma:** The moral obligation to aid others vs. personal freedom.  
**Key Passage:**
> “If it is within our power to prevent something bad from happening, without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it.”

💡 **Why?**  
Singer’s utilitarian perspective creates a dilemma: how much should individuals sacrifice for the greater good? Should personal wealth always be used to help those in need?

---

### **7️⃣ Michel Foucault – *Discipline and Punish* (1975)**
**Dilemma:** The contradiction between societal order and personal autonomy.  
**Key Passage:**
> “A body is docile that may be subjected, used, transformed and improved. The classical age discovered the body as an object and target of power.”

💡 **Why?**  
Foucault challenges **whether discipline and control create progress or oppression**, questioning **whether modern institutions (schools, prisons, hospitals) shape individuals or simply subjugate them**.

---

### **8️⃣ Robert Nozick – *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* (1974)**
**Dilemma:** Freedom vs. redistributive justice.  
**Key Passage:**
> “Taxation of earnings from labor is on a par with forced labor. Taking the earnings of n hours of labor is like forcing the person to work n hours for another’s purpose.”

💡 **Why?**  
Nozick’s libertarian argument suggests that taxation for redistribution is equivalent to forced labor. This creates a **deep philosophical dilemma**: is state-imposed redistribution a violation of liberty or a necessity for justice?

---

### **9️⃣ Elizabeth Anderson – *Private Government* (2017)**
**Dilemma:** The hidden authoritarianism in workplaces.  
**Key Passage:**
> “Most workplaces are private governments, complete with rules, punishments, and surveillance, yet we do not see them as such because they are shielded by the myth of free labor.”

💡 **Why?**  
Anderson challenges the common **distinction between public and private power**, questioning whether economic freedom can exist alongside workplace hierarchy.

---

### **🔟 Albert Camus – *The Myth of Sisyphus* (1942)**
**Dilemma:** The absurdity of life vs. the search for meaning.  
**Key Passage:**
> “There is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.”

💡 **Why?**  
Camus presents **a radical dilemma**—if life has no inherent meaning, is continued existence a rational choice?

> “Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data… the goal is to predict and modify human behavior at scale.”  

💡 **Why?**  
Zuboff presents a **fundamental tension between technological innovation and personal autonomy**—should we accept data-driven convenience at the cost of constant surveillance?

---

### **2️⃣ Kate Crawford – *Atlas of AI* (2021)**  
**Dilemma:** AI efficiency vs. systemic bias.  
**Key Passage:**  
> “AI is neither artificial nor intelligent—it is embedded in material resources, human labor, infrastructures, and power structures.”  

💡 **Why?**

---

### **4️⃣ Ruha Benjamin – *Race After Technology* (2019)**  
**Dilemma:** Innovation vs. social justice.  
**Key Passage:**  
> “Rather than asking whether technology is racist, we should ask how racial hierarchies shape technological design, and who benefits from them.”  

💡 **Why?**  
Benjamin challenges **the tech industry's assumption that innovation is progressive**, arguing that it often reinforces structural inequalities.

---

### **5️⃣ Evgeny Morozov – *To Save Everything, Click Here* (2013)**  
**Dilemma:** Digital governance vs. democratic accountability.  
**Key Passage:**  
> “The idea that digital technology will naturally lead to more democracy ignores history, which shows that centralized systems of control often flourish under the guise of efficiency.”  

💡 **Why?**  
Morozov critiques **"solutionism"**—the belief that tech can fix social problems—questioning whether digital platforms enhance democracy or consolidate power.

---

### **6️⃣ Samuel Moyn – *Humane: How the United States Abandoned Peace and Reinvented War* (2021)**  
**Dilemma:** Ethical warfare vs. the normalization of conflict.  
**Key Passage:**  
> “Making war more humane has made it more acceptable and perpetual, rather than bringing us closer to peace.”  

💡 **Why?**  
Moyn highlights **a moral paradox**—by reducing civilian casualties, have we made war more sustainable rather than less likely?

---

### **7️⃣ Anne Applebaum – *Twilight of Democracy* (2020)**  
**Dilemma:** Liberal democracy vs. rising authoritarianism.  
**Key Passage:**  
> “Democratic backsliding does not happen overnight; it happens gradually, through small changes to institutions and public discourse.”

> “Wherever there is judgment, there is noise—and yet we vastly underestimate how much variability affects our decisions.”  

💡 **Why?**  
This passage highlights a growing debate: should we replace **human decision-making with algorithmic systems** to reduce bias, even if that means losing intuition?

---

### **9️⃣ Arjun Appadurai – *Failure of Nostalgia* (2020)**  
**Dilemma:** Globalization vs. cultural identity.

---

### **🔟 Zeynep Tufekci – *Twitter and Tear Gas* (2017)**  
**Dilemma:** Social media activism vs. long-term political change.  
**Key Passage:**  
> “The speed of digital activism allows movements to emerge rapidly, but without the organizational depth needed to sustain real transformation.”  

💡 **Why?**  
Tufekci presents a **core dilemma of modern activism**—do viral movements create meaningful change, or do they fade quickly without institutional power?

### **1️⃣ Max Weber – *Politics as a Vocation* (1919)**
**Dilemma:** The ethical paradox of leadership – responsibility vs. moral integrity.  
**Key Passage:**
> “He who seeks the salvation of his soul, of his own and of others, should not seek it along the avenue of politics, for the quite different tasks of politics can only be solved by violence.”
